# Running a Django webapp inside a Docker container on AWS EC2 instance
## How to containerize a django application and run it on docker

I used a django todo app by made by [Shrey Shah](https://github.com/shreys7),  [web application](https://github.com/shreys7/django-todo) and I tried to containerize it. 

Here are the steps that I followed:
1. Create an EC2 instance using AWS with *Base image* as Linux 
2. Launch the instance
3. Launch the instance using ssh and .pem file
4. After connecting , make a directory as project.
5. goto project and clone the repository here

6. Now set the `security groups` of our EC2 instance. We have to `set inbound rules to allow traffic on port no 8000`.

For that we will go to **security group** and edit the **inbound rules**
7. add the rule with the name custom-TCP and allow the traffic on ipv4, `0.0.0.0`  port `8001`

## Creating a *Dockerfile*
we have to create docker image so that it can be run in a container
1. install Docker on our EC2 instance
  `sudo apt install docker.io`
  `vi Dockerfile`
### understanding the Dockerfile
   ```
   >>FROM python3
    1. This will create the **image** of OS i.e. ubuntu where python3 is already installed.

    ## For dependencies  of python
    //pip install django==3.2
    since , it is a cmd
    >>RUN pip install django==3.2
    ## Now we have to put the code in the box.
    >>COPY . .

    1st (dot). â†’ source (code from src where our docker file exists)

    2nd (dot). â†’ destination (container )
    
    >>`RUN python manage.py migrate`

    >>`CMD [ "python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8001"]`

    //CMD is in the form of an array
```

2. //now build our dockerfile which will build our image

3. `docker build . -t todoapp`

**t â†’ tag name**

*ps: it is python:3 in dockerfile*
`FROM python:3`

`d73552460333` : this is our image id
<br>
now to see if our image is running or not we will use the following command.
<br>
`sudo docker ps`
<br>
//we have to map the port of our system with docker image
<br>
`sudo docker run -p 8001:8001 d73552460333`

## *HURRAYYYYYYYYY! ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ§¡*

### Now our application is running

### tip:
 //to run it in background , you can use the docker run  command by simply adding -d
<br>
i.e.  docker daemon, and docker daemon runs in the background
